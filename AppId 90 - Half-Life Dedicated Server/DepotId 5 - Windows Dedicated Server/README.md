## Half-Life Dedicated Server (Windows)
### About
There is an ongoing Steam bug (28 May 2020) currently affecting AppId 90 (Half-Life Dedicated Server) for some users/regions. Installations on Windows for this AppId (both via Steam or steamcmd) may fail due to lack of subscription rights for Depot ID 5 (Windows Dedicated Server). This affects both anonymous logins, and logins for users who already have Half-Life/Cstrike/etc subscriptions. Steam will report that the App installed (or verified) successfully, but there will be missing executable binaries and DLL dependencies.

This archive contains all essential missing files (confirmed valid by manifest checksum), which can be used to complete an installation instance manually.
